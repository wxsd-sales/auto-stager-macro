## Overview

This macro monitors the hand raised state for each participant while on a Webex Meeting from a Cisco Collaboration Device.

When a meeting participant raises or lowers their hand the macro will automatically add or remove them from the Devices local stage.

The macro also lets you ensure the Active Speaker is always visible when raised hand participants have been moved to stage.

Lastly, the macro saves an in-call UI Extension panel to provide controls for toggling on or off this macro .
